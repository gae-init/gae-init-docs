  If the <code>&amp;next</code> argument is provided in the URL then this
  function will return its value.
</p>
<p>
  If the <code>&amp;next</code> argument is not present then it will return
  the <code>referrer</code> URL, but only if it's from the same domain.
  Very useful when you want to return to the same page that you've been
  before, after completing a certain action, like sign in page or edit of
  the form.

  When nothing is present it will simply return the url of the welcome page.

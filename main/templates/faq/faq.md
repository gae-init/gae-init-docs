#### Why do I need Node.js?

To install some dependences like CoffeeScript, LESS, UglifyJS, Grunt and Bower.
They are all installed inside the project's directory.

#### Why CoffeeScript?

Because it rocks!

#### Can I use JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript?

Yes, but you will not rock.

#### Why LESS?

Because it rocks as well!

#### Can I use CSS instead of LESS?

Yes, but you will not rock.

#### It rocks, but I still don't get it. Can you help me?

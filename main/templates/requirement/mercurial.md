[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) is optional, but strongly
recommended. While you can get the code in many different ways the easiest way
is to get it, is by using Mercurial.

After the installation make sure that you can run the `hg --help` command from
your terminal.

If you haven't used Mercurial before the [Hg Init](http://hginit.com/) is very
good Mercurial tutorial and a solid starting point written by
[Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html).

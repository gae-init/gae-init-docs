Even though Git is not really necessary to get the code and start developing,
it is needed by Bower in order to install the 3rd party front end libraries.

Install it by following the
[Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) guide by GitHub.

After the installation make sure that you are able to run the `git --version`
command from your terminal.

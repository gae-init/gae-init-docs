Before you even begin you have to make sure that you have all the
[requirements](http://docs.gae-init.appspot.com/requirement/)
installed to their latest versions.

Once this is done you can clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git foo
$ cd foo
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the result. If
you can see a normal functional page where you can [sign in](http://localhost:8080/signin/)
that means that everything went well and you are ready to start.
